# Foot-Work Blender Add-on

## Overview
The Foot-Work Blender Add-on is a toolset designed to assist animators in creating smooth locomotion.  
It currently consist of 2 sub-module
* **Offsetting** - offsetting keyframes with stride intervals. 
* **Ground Snapping** - Snap armature to ground. 

This add-on is particularly useful for generating realistic walking or running animations within the Blender environment.
